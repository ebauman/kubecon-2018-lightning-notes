## Automation is scary. Is there a future for humans? 

_Eamon's note: This is clickbait :)_

When a company like Tesla sets out to automate, are they being evil, or just capitalistic? 

## People have been panicking about automation for a long time. 

## The cycle: 

1. Complexity
2. Automation
3. Free time for new ideas

e.g. 
1. Complexity: bare metal
2. Automation: virtualization
3. Free time for new ideas: docker! 

# Keep calm, and automate on
